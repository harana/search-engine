# GitCreateTreeRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**tree** | [**Vec<models::GitCreateTreeRequestTreeInner>**](git_create_tree_request_tree_inner.md) | Objects (of `path`, `mode`, `type`, and `sha`) specifying a tree structure. | 
**base_tree** | Option<**String**> | The SHA1 of an existing Git tree object which will be used as the base for the new tree. If provided, a new Git tree object will be created from entries in the Git tree object pointed to by `base_tree` and entries defined in the `tree` parameter. Entries defined in the `tree` parameter will overwrite items from `base_tree` with the same `path`. If you're creating new changes on a branch, then normally you'd set `base_tree` to the SHA1 of the Git tree object of the current latest commit on the branch you're working on. If not provided, GitHub will create a new Git tree object from only the entries defined in the `tree` parameter. If you create a new commit pointing to such a tree, then all files which were a part of the parent commit's tree and were not defined in the `tree` parameter will be listed as deleted by the new commit. | [optional]
