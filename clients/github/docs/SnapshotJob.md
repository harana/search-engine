# SnapshotJob

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**id** | **String** | The external ID of the job. | 
**correlator** | **String** | Correlator provides a key that is used to group snapshots submitted over time. Only the \"latest\" submitted snapshot for a given combination of `job.correlator` and `detector.name` will be considered when calculating a repository's current dependencies. Correlator should be as unique as it takes to distinguish all detection runs for a given \"wave\" of CI workflow you run. If you're using GitHub Actions, a good default value for this could be the environment variables GITHUB_WORKFLOW and GITHUB_JOB concatenated together. If you're using a build matrix, then you'll also need to add additional key(s) to distinguish between each submission inside a matrix variation. | 
**html_url** | Option<**String**> | The url for the job. | [optional]
